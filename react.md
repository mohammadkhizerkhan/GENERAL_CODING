To prepare for your React-heavy and Node.js-focused interview at American Express, here’s a list of **intermediate and advanced concepts** to review. These are tailored to the job description, your resume, and the possibility of both theoretical and machine coding rounds:

---

### **React Concepts**
1. **State Management**:
   - Advanced Redux patterns (e.g., Redux Toolkit, RTK Query as mentioned in your resume).
   - Efficient state handling with Context API vs Redux.
   - Caching strategies and global state optimization.

2. **React Hooks**:
   - Comprehensive understanding of `useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`, `useReducer`, and custom hooks.
   - Handling complex side effects and dependency management.

3. **Component Design Patterns**:
   - Schema-driven UI rendering (as you implemented for dynamic forms in your projects).
   - Higher-order components (HOCs) vs Render props.
   - Compound components and reusable core components.

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Techniques like React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback to reduce unnecessary re-renders.
   - Virtualization libraries like react-window or react-virtualized.
   - Lazy loading with React.lazy and Suspense.

5. **Testing in React**:
   - Writing unit tests with Jest and React Testing Library.
   - Mocking API calls for frontend testing.
   - Snapshot testing and testing hooks/components.

6. **Accessibility (a11y)**:
   - ARIA roles/attributes and ensuring WCAG compliance.
   - Tools like Lighthouse or axe-core for accessibility audits.

7. **Error Handling**:
   - Implementing error boundaries for runtime error management.
   - Graceful fallback UI design.

### **Node.js Concepts**
1. **Core Node.js Fundamentals**:
   - Event loop, asynchronous programming, Promises, and async/await.
   - Streams (Readable/Writable/Transform) and their practical applications.

2. **API Development**:
   - RESTful API design principles.
   - Middleware in Express.js for request validation, logging, and error handling.
   - Authentication/authorization mechanisms (e.g., JWT).

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Clustering for scaling Node.js applications.
   - Profiling Node.js applications using tools like Clinic.js or built-in profiler.

4. **Security Best Practices**:
   - Preventing vulnerabilities like XSS, CSRF, SQL injection.
   - Securely handling sensitive data using environment variables (`dotenv`).

5. **Testing in Node.js**:
   - Writing unit tests with Jest/Mocha/Chai.
   - Integration testing using Supertest.

6. **Reliability & Monitoring**:
   - Logging frameworks like Winston or Bunyan.
   - Using Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring (as you’ve done in your projects).
   - Implementing alerts for critical production issues.

### **JavaScript & TypeScript**
1. **Advanced JavaScript Concepts**:
   - Closures, currying, debounce/throttle functions.
   - Prototypes vs ES6 classes; inheritance mechanisms.
   - Event delegation and bubbling/capturing phases.

2. **TypeScript Features**:
   - Interfaces vs types; utility types (`Pick`, `Partial`, `Omit`).
   - Generics for reusable components/functions.
   - Type narrowing, discriminated unions, and advanced type inference.

---

### **System Design & Architecture**
1. **Frontend Architecture**:
   - Micro-frontend architecture basics.
   - Component-driven development principles.

2. **Backend Architecture**:
   - Designing scalable APIs with load balancing techniques.
   - Database optimization strategies (e.g., indexing).

3. **DevOps Principles**:
   - CI/CD pipelines for React/Node.js projects.
   - Containerization basics with Docker.

---

### **Practical Coding Skills**
1. Build a small full-stack application that demonstrates:
   - Schema-driven dynamic form rendering with validation (similar to your past experience).
   - RESTful APIs with authentication/authorization logic.

2. Solve common algorithmic problems related to web development such as:
    * Debouncing/throttling inputs in forms or search bars.
    * Parsing deeply nested JSON objects dynamically.

3. Debugging production issues using logs or monitoring tools like Prometheus/Grafana (as highlighted in your resume).

By focusing on these topics, you will be well-prepared to handle both theoretical questions and hands-on coding tasks during the interview!
