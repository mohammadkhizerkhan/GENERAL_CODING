In Mongoose, using discriminators will not create a new collection or entity. Instead, discriminators add a new type-specific field (called a discriminator key) within the existing collection where the base schema (UserSchema in your example) is defined.

Hereâ€™s how it works:

Single Collection with Shared Fields: Discriminators allow multiple models to share a single collection. This shared collection uses the base schema (UserSchema), and any additional schemas (like ProviderSchema) are stored in the same collection.

Discriminator Key: When you define a discriminator, Mongoose will add a discriminator key to each document that indicates its specific model type. By default, this key is __t, and its value for a Provider document would be Provider. This key is used to differentiate between different types (like User and Provider) when querying the collection.

Additional Fields: Any fields specified in the discriminator schema (ProviderSchema) will only be added to documents created with that discriminator model. For example, documents created with the Provider model will have the company field, but regular User documents will not.

In your example:

javascript
Copy code
const userModel = require('./UserSchema.js');
const mongoose = require('mongoose'); 

var ProviderSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    company: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        trim: true,
    }
});

userModel.discriminator('Provider', ProviderSchema);
module.exports = mongoose.model('Provider');
Explanation:
This code will add documents of type Provider to the User collection, including the company field.
Each Provider document will have a __t field with the value Provider to identify its type.
Summary
No new collection is created; instead, Mongoose uses a single collection (in this case, User) and adds the discriminator-specific fields only to documents created with that discriminator model.

so basically instead of creating new entity/collection or writing redundant code for providerschema (which has most of the userSchema keys) we can just inherit and query it based on discriminator key

Exactly! Discriminators in Mongoose allow you to effectively inherit fields from a base schema (like UserSchema) into a specialized schema (like ProviderSchema) without creating a separate collection or duplicating code. This approach enables:

Efficient Code Reuse: The ProviderSchema inherits all the fields from UserSchema without duplicating schema definitions. You can add provider-specific fields (like company) to ProviderSchema, and these will only appear in documents created with the Provider model.

Simplified Queries: Since all documents are stored in the same collection, you can query by model type using the discriminator key (e.g., __t: 'Provider'), which helps to easily fetch records of specific types without managing multiple collections.

Centralized Schema Management: By having a single collection for related schemas, any changes to the shared fields in UserSchema automatically apply to all derived schemas, making updates easier to manage.

Example Query
To fetch all Provider documents:

javascript
Copy code
Provider.find({}, (err, providers) => {
    if (err) console.error(err);
    else console.log(providers);
});
This query will return only documents with the __t discriminator key set to Provider, filtering them out from the general User documents stored in the same collection.

Using discriminators is especially useful for applications with multiple types of users or entities sharing a large portion of the same data structure.
