## Overview
In a database, a view is a virtual table that is based on the result of a SQL query. Unlike a regular table, a view does not store data itself; instead, it provides a way to look at data stored in one or more tables.

## Here’s a breakdown of how views work:
<br/>

### Virtual Table: 
A view behaves like a table but is not physically stored in the database. It's created dynamically when queried.
### Based on Queries: 
Views are defined using a SELECT statement. This means you can pull data from one or multiple tables, perform joins, filter rows, and select specific columns.
### Security:
Views can help restrict access to specific data by exposing only certain columns or rows, making them useful for data security.
### Simplicity:
They simplify complex queries by encapsulating them into a view, so users can query the view instead of writing complex joins or filters.
For example:

``` 
sql
Copy code
CREATE VIEW customer_orders AS
SELECT customer_id, order_id, order_date
FROM orders
WHERE status = 'completed';
This creates a view named customer_orders that shows only completed orders.
```

## Key Points: 
<br/>

### Non-Persistent: 
Views don’t hold data; they just represent it.
Updatable: In some cases, views can be updated, and the changes will reflect in the underlying tables (with certain conditions).
Performance: Views might not always improve performance as they need to run the underlying query each time they are accessed.
In short, views are a useful tool for simplifying database interactions, improving security, and organizing data logically.

## Nutshell understanding
<br/>

### Complex Query Once:
You write the complex query that joins or aggregates data from multiple tables just one time when creating the view.

### Simple Queries on the View:
After the view is created, you can write simple queries against the view (like selecting data or filtering it), which will run the complex query in the background automatically.

### Behind the Scenes:
Whenever you query the view, the complex query that defines the view is executed in the background. This saves you from having to rewrite the same complex logic every time.

### For example:
You create a view that joins 10 different tables and performs some calculations:
```
CREATE VIEW final_data AS
SELECT t1.name, t2.total_sales, SUM(t3.revenue)
FROM table1 t1
JOIN table2 t2 ON t1.id = t2.customer_id
JOIN table3 t3 ON t2.id = t3.order_id
-- More joins and logic...
WHERE t1.region = 'North';
```
Now, instead of running this long query every time, you can run simple queries like:

```
SELECT name, total_sales FROM final_data WHERE total_sales > 1000;
```
<br/>
The complex query is still executed each time you query the view, but you avoid writing it repeatedly. However, be mindful that views don’t always improve performance since the underlying query must be run whenever the view is accessed.
So, your understanding is on point—the view simplifies query writing but still executes the complex logic behind the scenes whenever it’s queried.
