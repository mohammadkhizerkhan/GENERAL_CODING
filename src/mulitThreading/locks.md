# Synchronization and Lock Mechanisms in Java

## Introduction

In a multithreaded environment, synchronization is crucial to prevent threads from interfering with each other and causing data inconsistencies. This document covers the various synchronization mechanisms in Java, including intrinsic locks, explicit locks, ReadWriteLocks, mutexes, and ReentrantLocks. Understanding and properly utilizing these mechanisms is key to developing robust and error-free multithreaded applications.

## The Problem: Thread Interference and Data Inconsistency

When multiple threads access shared resources (such as shared data structures) without proper synchronization, it can lead to thread interference and inconsistencies. For example, consider two threads trying to update a shared counter concurrently:

```java
public class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    public void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Counter counter = new Counter();
        
        Runnable task = () -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        };

        Thread thread1 = new Thread(task);
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(task);

        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();

        try {
            thread1.join();
            thread2.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        System.out.println("Final count: " + counter.getCount());
    }
}
```

In this example, the final count should be 2000, but due to thread interference, the actual result may be less.
i.e thread1 and thread2 might increment counter at same time(for ex: 34+1) since they are sharing same resources

## Synchronization: The Solution

To solve these issues, Java provides synchronization mechanisms to control access to shared resources.

### Synchronized Keyword

The simplest synchronization mechanism is the `synchronized` keyword, which can be applied to methods or blocks of code to ensure mutual exclusion.

#### Synchronized Method

```java
public class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public synchronized int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}
```

#### Synchronized Block

```java
public class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    public void increment() {
        synchronized(this) {
            count++;
        }
    }

    public int getCount() {
        synchronized(this) {
            return count;
        }
    }
}
```

### Intrinsic Locks

Every object in Java has an intrinsic lock (or monitor) associated with it. When a thread enters a synchronized method or block, it acquires the intrinsic lock. If another thread attempts to enter a synchronized method or block while the lock is held, it will be blocked until the lock is released.

## Explicit Locks

While intrinsic locks are simple and easy to use, they have limitations. For more advanced use cases, Java provides explicit lock mechanisms through the `java.util.concurrent.locks` package.

### Lock Interface

The `Lock` interface provides explicit locking operations. It offers more flexible and sophisticated synchronization mechanisms compared to intrinsic locks.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class Counter {
    private int count = 0;
    private final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();

    public void increment() {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            count++;
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }

    public int getCount() {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            return count;
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
}
```

### Difference Between Intrinsic Locks and Explicit Locks

- **Intrinsic Locks**: Implicitly acquired by using the `synchronized` keyword. Simple to use but less flexible.
- **Explicit Locks**: Manually acquired and released using the `Lock` interface. More control and flexibility but require more careful handling.

### Methods of Explicit Locks

- `lock()`: Acquires the lock.
- `unlock()`: Releases the lock.
- `tryLock()`: Attempts to acquire the lock without blocking.
- `tryLock(long time, TimeUnit unit)`: Attempts to acquire the lock within the given waiting time.

Let's dive into the usage of `lock()`, `unlock()`, `tryLock()`, and `tryLock(long time, TimeUnit unit)` in the context of explicit locks in Java. We'll explore these methods through code examples to clarify their usage and significance.

## Lock Interface Methods

### lock(): Acquires the Lock

The `lock()` method acquires the lock if it is available. If the lock is not available, the current thread becomes disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until the lock is acquired.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class LockExample {

    private final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
    private int sharedResource = 0;

    public void increment() {
        lock.lock();  // Acquires the lock
        try {
            sharedResource++;
            System.out.println("Incremented to: " + sharedResource);
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();  // Releases the lock
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LockExample example = new LockExample();

        Runnable task = example::increment;

        Thread thread1 = new Thread(task);
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(task);

        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
    }
}
```

### unlock(): Releases the Lock

The `unlock()` method releases the lock. It is usually placed in a `finally` block to ensure that the lock is released even if an exception occurs.

### tryLock(): Attempts to Acquire the Lock Without Blocking

The `tryLock()` method attempts to acquire the lock without blocking. It returns `true` if the lock is acquired immediately and `false` if the lock is not available.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class TryLockExample {

    private final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
    private int sharedResource = 0;

    public void increment() {
        if (lock.tryLock()) {  // Attempts to acquire the lock without blocking
            try {
                sharedResource++;
                System.out.println("Incremented to: " + sharedResource);
            } finally {
                lock.unlock();  // Releases the lock
            }
        } else {
            System.out.println("Could not acquire lock, doing other work");
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TryLockExample example = new TryLockExample();

        Runnable task = example::increment;

        Thread thread1 = new Thread(task);
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(task);

        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
    }
}
```

### tryLock(long time, TimeUnit unit): Attempts to Acquire the Lock Within the Given Waiting Time

The `tryLock(long time, TimeUnit unit)` method attempts to acquire the lock within the specified waiting time. It returns `true` if the lock is acquired and `false` if the waiting time elapses before acquiring the lock.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class TimedTryLockExample {

    private final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
    private int sharedResource = 0;

    public void increment() {
        try {
            if (lock.tryLock(2, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {  // Attempts to acquire the lock within 2 seconds
                try {
                    sharedResource++;
                    System.out.println("Incremented to: " + sharedResource);
                } finally {
                    lock.unlock();  // Releases the lock
                }
            } else {
                System.out.println("Could not acquire lock within the given time, doing other work");
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.out.println("Thread was interrupted while waiting for the lock");
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TimedTryLockExample example = new TimedTryLockExample();

        Runnable task = example::increment;

        Thread thread1 = new Thread(task);
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(task);

        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
    }
}
```

## Explanation

### lock() Method

- **What it does**: The `lock()` method is a blocking call that waits until the lock becomes available.
- **When to use**: Use `lock()` when you need to ensure that only one thread accesses the critical section at any time and you are okay with blocking the thread until the lock is available.
- **Example**: In the `increment()` method above, `lock.lock()` ensures that only one thread increments the `sharedResource` at a time.

### unlock() Method

- **What it does**: The `unlock()` method releases the lock acquired by the current thread.
- **When to use**: Always use `unlock()` in a `finally` block to ensure that the lock is released even if an exception occurs. This prevents deadlocks and ensures that other threads can acquire the lock.
- **Example**: In the `increment()` method above, `lock.unlock()` releases the lock after the critical section is executed.

### tryLock() Method

- **What it does**: The `tryLock()` method attempts to acquire the lock without blocking. It returns immediately with a boolean value indicating whether the lock was acquired.
- **When to use**: Use `tryLock()` when you want to perform an action only if the lock is immediately available, avoiding blocking the thread.
- **Example**: In the `TryLockExample`, `tryLock()` checks if the lock is available and either increments the resource or does other work.

### tryLock(long time, TimeUnit unit) Method

- **What it does**: The `tryLock(long time, TimeUnit unit)` method attempts to acquire the lock within the specified waiting time, returning a boolean value based on whether the lock was acquired within that time.
- **When to use**: Use this method when you are willing to wait for a certain period to acquire the lock but do not want to block indefinitely.
- **Example**: In the `TimedTryLockExample`, the thread waits for up to 2 seconds to acquire the lock before doing alternative work.

## Conclusion

Understanding and properly utilizing these lock methods is crucial for developing safe and efficient multithreaded applications. Explicit locks like `ReentrantLock` provide greater control and flexibility compared to intrinsic locks (`synchronized`). By using methods such as `lock()`, `unlock()`, `tryLock()`, and `tryLock(long time, TimeUnit unit)`, developers can create robust solutions to handle concurrent access to shared resources effectively.

### ReadWriteLock

The `ReadWriteLock` interface provides a pair of locks: one for read-only operations and one for write operations. This allows multiple threads to read concurrently while ensuring that write operations have exclusive access.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReadWriteLock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock;

public class Counter {
    private int count = 0;
    private final ReadWriteLock rwLock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();

    public void increment() {
        rwLock.writeLock().lock();
        try {
            count++;
        } finally {
            rwLock.writeLock().unlock();
        }
    }

    public int getCount() {
        rwLock.readLock().lock();
        try {
            return count;
        } finally {
            rwLock.readLock().unlock();
        }
    }
}
```

## Why Locks are Necessary

Locks are necessary to:

1. Ensure mutual exclusion: Only one thread can execute a critical section at a time.
2. Prevent race conditions: Ensure that shared data is safely modified.
3. Coordinate thread actions: Ensure proper sequencing of operations.

## Mutex

A mutex (mutual exclusion) is a synchronization primitive that ensures only one thread can access a resource at a time. In Java, this is achieved using intrinsic locks (`synchronized`) or explicit locks (`Lock`).

## ReentrantLock

The `ReentrantLock` class is a reentrant lock, meaning a thread can reacquire the same lock it already holds without deadlocking. It provides more advanced features compared to intrinsic locks.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class Counter {
    private int count = 0;
    private final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();

    public void increment() {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            count++;
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }

    public int getCount() {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            return count;
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
}
```

## Example with Interrupting Locks

Explicit locks allow thread interruptions, which provide better control over thread execution.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class InterruptibleLockExample {
    private final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();

    public void performTask() {
        try {
            lock.lockInterruptibly();
            try {
                // Simulate some work
                System.out.println("Locked by " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
                Thread.sleep(2000);
            } finally {
                lock.unlock();
                System.out.println("Unlocked by " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " interrupted.");
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        InterruptibleLockExample example = new InterruptibleLockExample();

        Thread t1 = new Thread(example::performTask, "Thread 1");
        Thread t2 = new Thread(example::performTask, "Thread 2");

        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        // Interrupt second thread after 1 second
        try {
            Thread.sleep(1000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        t2.interrupt();
    }
}
```

In this example, `Thread 2` will be interrupted if it cannot acquire the lock within the specified time.

## Conclusion

Synchronization and lock mechanisms in Java are essential for ensuring safe and consistent access to shared resources in a multithreaded environment. The `synchronized` keyword, intrinsic locks, and explicit locks (like `ReentrantLock` and `ReadWriteLock`) provide various levels of control and flexibility to meet different synchronization needs. By understanding and effectively utilizing these mechanisms, developers can build robust and thread-safe Java applications.


# Fairness of Locks and Deadlocks in Java

## Introduction

In multithreaded programming, fairness of locks and deadlock are two critical concepts that need careful consideration to ensure smooth and efficient execution of concurrent tasks. This document will delve into these topics, providing an understanding of what fairness and deadlock are, along with their implications, prevention techniques, and handling mechanisms using Java's `ReentrantLock`.

## Fairness of Locks

### What is Fairness?

Fairness in locking mechanisms refers to the order in which threads acquire the lock. A fair lock ensures that the longest-waiting thread gets the lock first (FIFO order). An unfair lock, on the other hand, does not guarantee any particular order, sometimes favoring newly requesting threads over existing waiting threads, which might lead to starvation of long-waiting threads.

### How Fairness Works

- **Fair Locks**: Provide a predictable order of acquiring locks, preventing thread starvation.
- **Unfair Locks**: Do not guarantee an order, potentially offering better throughput under high contention by reducing overhead but at the risk of starvation for some threads.

### Implementing Fair Locks in Java

In Java, `ReentrantLock` provides an option to create a fair lock. By default, `ReentrantLock` is unfair. You can create a fair lock by passing `true` to its constructor.

#### Example of Fair Lock

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class FairLockExample {
    private final Lock fairLock = new ReentrantLock(true);  // Creating a fair lock

    public void performTask() {
        fairLock.lock();
        try {
            // Simulate some work
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " acquired the fair lock");
            Thread.sleep(100);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            fairLock.unlock();
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " released the fair lock");
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FairLockExample example = new FairLockExample();

        Runnable task = example::performTask;

        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            new Thread(task, "Thread-" + i).start();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the fair lock ensures that threads acquire the lock in the order they requested it, preventing starvation.

## Deadlocks

### What is a Deadlock?

A deadlock is a situation where two or more threads are blocked forever, each waiting for the other to release a resource. This situation occurs when the following conditions hold simultaneously:

1. **Mutual Exclusion**: At least one resource is held in a non-shareable mode.
2. **Hold and Wait**: A process holding at least one resource is waiting to acquire additional resources held by other processes.
3. **No Preemption**: Resources cannot be forcibly taken from a process; they must be released voluntarily.
4. **Circular Wait**: A set of processes are waiting for each other in a circular chain.

### Avoiding Deadlocks

To avoid deadlocks, you can:
1. Use a timeout with lock acquisition.
2. Apply a consistent order of acquiring locks.
3. Use a lock hierarchy to avoid circular dependencies.

### Example of Potential Deadlock

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class DeadlockExample {
    private final Lock lock1 = new ReentrantLock();
    private final Lock lock2 = new ReentrantLock();

    public void method1() {
        lock1.lock();
        try {
            // Simulate work
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " acquired lock1");
            Thread.sleep(50);

            lock2.lock();
            try {
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " acquired lock2");
            } finally {
                lock2.unlock();
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            lock1.unlock();
        }
    }

    public void method2() {
        lock2.lock();
        try {
            // Simulate work
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " acquired lock2");
            Thread.sleep(50);

            lock1.lock();
            try {
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " acquired lock1");
            } finally {
                lock1.unlock();
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            lock2.unlock();
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DeadlockExample example = new DeadlockExample();

        Runnable task1 = example::method1;
        Runnable task2 = example::method2;

        new Thread(task1).start();
        new Thread(task2).start();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `method1` locks `lock1` and waits for `lock2` while `method2` locks `lock2` and waits for `lock1`. This circular wait condition causes a deadlock.

### Resolving Deadlocks

#### Using tryLock with Timeout

By using `tryLock()` with a timeout, you can attempt to acquire the lock while avoiding indefinite blocking, which helps prevent deadlocks.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class DeadlockPreventionExample {
    private final Lock lock1 = new ReentrantLock();
    private final Lock lock2 = new ReentrantLock();

    public void method1() {
        try {
            if (lock1.tryLock(50, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)) {
                try {
                    System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " acquired lock1");
                    Thread.sleep(50);

                    if (lock2.tryLock(50, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)) {
                        try {
                            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " acquired lock2");
                        } finally {
                            lock2.unlock();
                        }
                    } else {
                        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " could not acquire lock2");
                    }
                } finally {
                    lock1.unlock();
                }
            } else {
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " could not acquire lock1");
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    public void method2() {
        try {
            if (lock2.tryLock(50, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)) {
                try {
                    System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " acquired lock2");
                    Thread.sleep(50);

                    if (lock1.tryLock(50, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)) {
                        try {
                            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " acquired lock1");
                        } finally {
                            lock1.unlock();
                        }
                    } else {
                        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " could not acquire lock1");
                    }
                } finally {
                    lock2.unlock();
                }
            } else {
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " could not acquire lock2");
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DeadlockPreventionExample example = new DeadlockPreventionExample();

        Runnable task1 = example::method1;
        Runnable task2 = example::method2;

        new Thread(task1).start();
        new Thread(task2).start();
    }
}
```

In this example, `tryLock()` with a timeout is used to avoid deadlock by ensuring that threads do not wait indefinitely to acquire locks.

## Conclusion

Fairness of locks and deadlock prevention are crucial aspects of multithreaded programming. Fair locks ensure that threads are granted locks in the order they request them, preventing starvation. Deadlocks can create situations where threads block each other indefinitely, and it's essential to take measures to prevent them. Using explicit locks like `ReentrantLock` with features such as `tryLock` and `tryLock(long time, TimeUnit unit)` provides greater control and flexibility to handle these challenges effectively. By applying these strategies and understanding the underlying concepts, developers can build robust and efficient multithreaded applications.
