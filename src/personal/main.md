It sounds like you have a lot on your plate, and it's great to see that you're proactively thinking about your future and how to achieve your personal and professional goals. Let's break down your concerns and provide a structured approach that can help you move forward with clarity and purpose.

### Step 1: Set Clear Goals

#### Personal Goals:
1. **Physical Health**: Regular exercise and a balanced diet.
2. **Mental Health**: Activities like meditation or hobbies that relax you.
3. **Social Life**: Building meaningful relationships and exploring the world.

#### Professional Goals:
1. **Skill Development**: Enhancing your backend and DevOps skills.
2. **Career Progression**: Preparing for and succeeding in job interviews to switch companies for better opportunities.
3. **Long-Term Career Vision**: Deciding on a future-proof career path (Backend with DevOps, Web3, Product Management, etc.).

### Step 2: Skill Development

#### Backend and DevOps:
1. **Backend Development**: Focus on mastering Node.js, Express, and databases like MongoDB and PostgreSQL. Learn about microservices architecture.
2. **DevOps**: Learn Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins), cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure).
3. **Go**: It's a great language for backend development and infrastructure services due to its performance and concurrency model. It can be valuable in DevOps for building efficient tools and services.

#### Emerging Technologies:
1. **AI in Frontend**: Stay updated but don't solely rely on this; frontend engineering still requires human creativity and interaction skills.
2. **Web3**: Understand blockchain basics, smart contracts, and frameworks like Solidity. You can learn it in parallel with web2 skills.

### Step 3: Career Choices and AI Impact

1. **Quant vs. Full-Stack/Backend**: Quant roles are specialized and generally require a strong background in mathematics and finance. Full-stack/backend engineering with system-level and infrastructure knowledge is less likely to be fully replaced by AI.
2. **Product Management**: If you are interested in non-coding roles, this is a good option, but it requires excellent communication, strategic thinking, and leadership skills.

### Step 4: Structured Planning

#### Daily/Weekly:
- **Exercise**: Dedicate time each day for physical activity.
- **Learning**: Allocate specific hours daily to learn backend/DevOps/Web3.
- **Interview Preparation**: Practice coding problems, work on mock interviews.

#### Monthly:
- **Skill Progress**: Track your learning progress; set monthly learning goals.
- **Networking**: Attend meetups, webinars, and connect with professionals on LinkedIn.

#### Yearly:
- **Career Review**: Evaluate your career progress and make necessary adjustments.
- **Personal Growth**: Plan a vacation or a new experience to enrich your personal life.

### Step 5: Balancing Job Hunt and Personal Growth

1. **Interview Preparation**:
   - Schedule specific time slots for interview prep.
   - Focus on coding challenges, system design, and behavioral questions.

2. **Personal Growth**:
   - Dedicate time every day or week for activities that rejuvenate you (e.g., hobbies, socializing).

3. **Mental Stability**:
   - Practice mindfulness or meditation to stay centered.
   - Break tasks into smaller, manageable steps to avoid feeling overwhelmed.

### Step 6: Practical Steps Starting Today

1. **Create a Schedule**: Use a planner or a digital calendar. Block time for job prep, skill learning, exercise, and relaxation.
2. **Set Immediate Goals**: Focus on the next 3 months for interviews, skill updates, and exercise.
3. **Small Wins**: Celebrate small achievements to keep motivated.

  - 6:00 AM – 7:00 AM: Exercise
  - 7:00 AM – 8:00 AM: Breakfast and relaxation
